I spent over an hour trying to figure out why I wasn&#8217;t able

to do basic authentication in a web2py service before I ran across a prior post thatÂ described this essential step.

If you&#8217;re using Apache with mod_wsgi and you want to use basic

authentication with a web2py service, don&#8217;t forget to add the line

&#8220;WSGIPassAuthorization On&#8221; to wsgi.conf under /etc/apache2/mods-

enabled.

Or in your vhost settings:

> ServerName www.mainserver.com
> 
> ServerAlias super.alias.nl mainserver.com
> 
> WSGIDaemonProcess mainserver user=appuser group=appuser \
> 
> display-name=%{GROUP}
> 
> WSGIProcessGroup mainserver
> 
> WSGIScriptAlias / /webapps/mainserver/wsgihandler.py
> 
> WSGIPassAuthorization On
