I recently stopped using my old workstation (a 6 year old home made quad core, with nice specs and still very usable but noisy. It had a lot of boot problems failing harddisk and other crazy stuff) and switched to a MSI 2050 All in one PC for a while. I don&#8217;t like the unity desktop experience provided by default Ubuntu 11.10 and switched to KDE for a while. But KDE feels kinda slow. So I tried XFCE4 and was very impressed by it&#8217;s speed and usability. While looking at XFce4 info; I also found LXDE; so I tested them both.

Tested it on Ubuntu and Debian systems. One slight problem with my dual screen setup could be resolved with:

xrandr &#8211;output HDMI-0 &#8211;auto &#8211;right-of DVI-0

**Xfce4**

XFCE looks nice, is fast to use, and doesn&#8217;t slow down working with nice standard keyboard shortcuts. It comes with some optional tools for screencapture and harddisk temp monitoring. It&#8217;s menu and windows placement, won&#8217;t mean that you need 3 years of your life to get used to Unity&#8217;s left side orientation of the current Ubuntu versions.

_Xfce on Debian testing_

XFCE feels kinda &#8220;at home&#8221; by using an almost classic win98 setup of OS GUI elements. It has a nice filemanager and can been run in a nice mix between Gnome/Unity and XFCE: lean and mean. Things like Dropbox integration in Filemanager are possible. With a little work you can give your users a &#8220;windows like&#8221; experience

**LXDE
  
** The &#8220;Lightweight X11 Desktop Environment&#8221; is an extremely fast-performing and energy-saving desktop environment.  It&#8217;s a even faster then Xfce4.

_LXDE on Ubuntu 12.04_

After a couple of weeks: It useable for a work only setup. But when you als have a couple of macs with a nice filemanager and all kind of graphic bling bling it&#8217;s feeling kind of dull. For &#8220;just working&#8221; it&#8217;s perfect. You can change it trough GUI or by editing in simple conf or XML files. But after a couple of weeks you experience small things that I take for granted in other OSes nowadays; Dropxbox or Google Drive integration in Right click menuus in File Manager tools; just don&#8217;t work.  Never got volume applet working, notification area isn&#8217;t working that well. More like some small annoyances.

Still both options leave you wet a very workable, multi virtuel desktop, multi screen desktop solution that will run very smooth and reliable on cheap hardware. And it&#8217;s all free.
