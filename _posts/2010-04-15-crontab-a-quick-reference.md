**cron** is a utility that you can use to schedule and automate tasks. By defining items in the cron table, called **crontab**, you can schedule any script or program to run on almost any sort of schedule.

For example, run a program each day 5 minutes after midnight on mondays, wednesdays and fridays. Or schedule something to run every five minutes, or once a month.

### Basics

Each user has their own crontab, the scheduled scripts run as that user take this in account with regards to permissions. To edit the crontab use the following command:
  
`$ crontab -e`

You can list what your currnet crontab is using the following command:
  
`$ crontab -l`

**Crontab Format**
  
The following is the format entries in a crontab must be. Note all lines starting with # are ignored, comments.

<pre># MIN   HOUR   MDAY  MON  DOW   COMMAND 
   5     *      *     *    *    echo 'Hello'</pre>

### Examples

Here are a few examples, to see what some entries look like.

`<br />
#Run command at 7:00am each weekday [mon-fri]<br />
00 07 * * 1-5 mail_pager.script 'Wake Up'`

#Run command on 1st of each month, at 5:30pm
  
30 17 1 \* \* pay_rent.script

#Run command at 8:00am,10:00am and 2:00pm every day
  
00 8,10,14 \* \* * do_something.script

#Run command every 5 minutes during market hours
  
\*/5 6-13 \* * mon-fri get\_stock\_quote.script

#Run command every 3-hours while awake
  
0 7-23/3 \* \* * drink_water.script

### Special Characters in Crontab

You can use an **asterisk** in any category to mean for every item, such as every day or every month.

You can use **commas** in any category to specify multiple values. For example: `mon,wed,fri`

You can use **dashes** to specify ranges. For example: `mon-fri`, or `9-17`

You can use **forward slash** to specify a repeating range. For example: `*/5` for every five minutes, hours, days

### Special Entries

There are several special entries, some which are just shortcuts, that you can use instead of specifying the full cron entry.

The most useful of these is probably **@reboot** which allows you to run a command each time the computer gets reboot. This could be useful if you want to start up a server or daemon under a particular user, or if you do not have access to the rc.d/init.d files.

### Examples

Here are a few examples, to see what some entries look like.

`<br />
#Run command at 7:00am each weekday [mon-fri]<br />
00 07 * * 1-5 mail_pager.script 'Wake Up'`

#Run command on 1st of each month, at 5:30pm
  
30 17 1 \* \* pay_rent.script

#Run command at 8:00am,10:00am and 2:00pm every day
  
00 8,10,14 \* \* * do_something.script

#Run command every 5 minutes during market hours
  
\*/5 6-13 \* * mon-fri get\_stock\_quote.script

#Run command every 3-hours while awake
  
0 7-23/3 \* \* * drink_water.script

### Special Characters in Crontab

You can use an **asterisk** in any category to mean for every item, such as every day or every month.

You can use **commas** in any category to specify multiple values. For example: `mon,wed,fri`

You can use **dashes** to specify ranges. For example: `mon-fri`, or `9-17`

You can use **forward slash** to specify a repeating range. For example: `*/5` for every five minutes, hours, days

### Special Entries

There are several special entries, some which are just shortcuts, that you can use instead of specifying the full cron entry.

The most useful of these is probably **@reboot** which allows you to run a command each time the computer gets reboot. This could be useful if you want to start up a server or daemon under a particular user, or if you do not have access to the rc.d/init.d files.

**Example Usage:** 
  
``**cron** is a utility that you can use to schedule and automate tasks. By defining items in the cron table, called **crontab**, you can schedule any script or program to run on almost any sort of schedule.

For example, run a program each day 5 minutes after midnight on mondays, wednesdays and fridays. Or schedule something to run every five minutes, or once a month.

### Basics

Each user has their own crontab, the scheduled scripts run as that user take this in account with regards to permissions. To edit the crontab use the following command:
  
`$ crontab -e`

You can list what your currnet crontab is using the following command:
  
`$ crontab -l`

**Redirect Output to /dev/null**
  
You can redirect the output from a cron script to /dev/null which just throws it away. By redirecting to /dev/null you will not receive anything from the script, even if it is throwing errors.

```` 

**Missed Schedule Time**
  
Cron does not run a command if it was missed. Your computer must be running for cron to run the job at the time it is scheduled. For example, if you have a 1:00am scheduled job and your computer was off at that time, it will **not** run the missed job in the morning when you turn it on.
