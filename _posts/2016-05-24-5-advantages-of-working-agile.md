Agile software development is the preferred way for a lot of companies and succesfull software projects nowadays. As a professional software developer I used a lot of methods in the last years. School drilled me with traditional waterfall approaches like SDM and SDM II, this quickly changed to the Rational Unified Process (RUP) and a more eXtreme Programming XP kind of style during my internship. 

The problem with the traditional methods, in an enterprise world is iteration. Although they pretend to iterate, in practice iteration is almost never feasible, because of time pressure. SDM freezes software requirements at the start of the project, while in practice changes always occur, especially with *new* projects. I thinks this was responsible for a lot of failures in big software projects in the late 90's. Developing good software is a more organic process, in a couple of iterations you will get to a good solution for a problem.

So what's Scrum about? Scrum is a efficient way to develop software with a self organizing development team that works in fixed length sprints on releasing incremental better software. After each sprint a short demo is organised for the stakeholders and the development team has a meeting about what went ok in the last sprint and what could have gone better. Then the next sprint is started.

## Developing with Scrum is a lot of fun
When a team is profient there will be almost no deadline stress, no super long meetings, no long planning meetings and almost no management. After a couple of sprints the team gets into a cadence and because releasing is already an habit then it causes less stress reaching a big milestone; it's just another finished sprint.

The Daily Stand Up meeting is enough in most cases to determine the focus, risks and impediments of the team members. Detailed lanning is mostly done for just a couple of sprints by the team with tools like; planning poker and story points.

The team members are the ones that pick what to do and when for the given iteration. This takes time when people are not used to it, but ends up making team members happier because nobody is dictating who gets to do what. They decide.

Because releasing incremental better software is a must you'll get a system that quickly evolves to a solution instead of trying to arrive with a one big bang at some suboptimal solution

## You will deliver tested software every sprint
I can't emphasize this enough, testing is an integral part of SCRUM. If you work with scrum and don't test you software you are not scrumming, sorry. By testing I mean running fully automated unit tests, to ensure quality is as expected and refactoring code doesn't accidentaly break other parts of the system.

Each ticket in a sprint will go trough at least 4 stages: Not started, In progress, Testing, Done. Most Scrum teams use a, analog or digital, cardwall with columns containing the tickets for each stage. For the team mebers this is the primary way to keep track of the current sprint progress, and to adapt to problems in the flow/team.

As the stakeholders get a demo of the release they will be triggered to think about the possibilities. Often this will result in small changes in the roadmap, to adapt to new business oppurtunities, or new user wishes.

Because scrum encourages changes you will deliver software that suits the changing perspective and requirements of the stakeholders better. It's very hard for humans to define a complex system in their heads; idea's start to live when people experiment with them. Other software methods will often kill the ability to adapt a running software development process as it's very costly to change all the requirement docs or all the planning. In Scrum you're planning get's more detailed towards the end, and stuff that's really done will get documented. This ensures the possibility to adapt and iterate without sacrificing the project quality.

## The process is transparant
Scrum, as other Agile methods, uses feedback to improve the process, it relies on transparancy. This leads to an open culture in which team members are stimulated to share their feelings and input. It's also important that team members can express impediments.

Scrum theory states: 'Significant aspects of the process must be visible to those responsible for the outcome.' Scrum prescribes four formal events for inspection and adaptation:

Sprint Planning
Daily Scrum
Sprint Review
Sprint Retrospective

As you may nave noticed, there is no such thing as a big planning. Only sprints are planned, by the team that does the work. This has quite an impact on a more traditional way of work were project managers are used to manage the project. Management will get a lot of info on each sprint end and by meeting with the product owner. The team will have all the info they need because they reach a concensus, on a per ticket basis, before a sprint is started in the sprnt refinement meetings. They will also be trained, and getting skilled at, defining a Definition of Done for each item. It's all about minimising communication overhead while maintaining a shared knowledge domain around a project with less effort.

## A good Scrum implementation minimises the bus factor
Yes, even when you work with Scrum you have to write documentation. But you will write documentation when needed. Furthermore knowledge is shared within the team, there are no team hero's or key persons, no single point of failure
as this would be handled in a retrospective.

## Productivity is high with high stakeholder satisfaction
When a team is succesful doing scrum a while it's will be very productive.
