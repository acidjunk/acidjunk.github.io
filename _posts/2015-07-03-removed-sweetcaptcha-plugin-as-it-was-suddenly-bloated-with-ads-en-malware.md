SweetCaptcha is a free CAPTCHA service that offers to match “sweet” images instead of making you recognize distorted digits and characters. It&#8217;s a fun captcha service where a user has to solve a small puzzle by dragging the correct icon to another icon.

It worked flawlessly for the last couple of years but it looks liked they changed their business model somewhere in juni; creating a popup for first time users/visitors of my blog with some really nasty malware download links. When I first encountered it myself I thought my blog was defaced; but after some googling I found a lot of people with the same experience.

An excellent writeup: https://blog.sucuri.net/2015/06/sweetcaptcha-service-used-to-distribute-adware.html

So I decided to remove sweetcaptcha and use another captcha solution instead.
